# Car2DGameCPP
Simple 2D car game made in c++

I made this project as University project for the coding course, in a group with three other people.

In the game there is a car that is controlled by the user, the goal is to avoid the obstacles as long as possible.
As the time goes the obstacles became more and they make more damage, the game end when the point is less than 0.
I hope it may help somebody else trying to do a similar thing.
